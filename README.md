 Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression

Objective

Build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression and understand how to evaluate and interpret its performance.



Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – for data handling

Scikit-learn – for model building, evaluation

Matplotlib – for visualizations


Dataset

Dataset Used: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset 





Steps Performed

1. Loaded and preprocessed the dataset:

Checked for missing values

Encoded categorical features (if any)

Standardized feature values



2. Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().


3. Trained a Logistic Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.


4. Evaluated model performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Precision and Recall

ROC-AUC Score

Accuracy Score



5. Plotted the ROC curve and explained the sigmoid function used in logistic regression.


6. Tuned the decision threshold and observed how metrics changed accordingly.
